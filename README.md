# PCIP-Proyecto-Corporativo-de-Indizacion-de-Periodicos

PCIP is a webpage that displays a large amount of old newspaper data from Puerto Rico. 
This webpage is a remake of the original one and was done for my Databases course final project. 

The project was initially created by a librarian/it guy at the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico. 

Tech: HTML5, Bootstrap, Js, jQuery, PHP, SQLite ;
